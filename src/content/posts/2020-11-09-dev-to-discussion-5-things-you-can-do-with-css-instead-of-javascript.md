### **Discuss Part 1**

1. Give your own tldr; (too long, didn't read) for all of us. OK, you read it; now give us a one or two liner description for us as to what the article is all about.\
   The article goes over 5 useful things that can be done with CSS instead of JavaScript
2. What is your take on what you read?\
   While not the most important or likely to be used techniques, the things gone over in the article are important to have in your web design toolkit. The CSS that the author goes over is easier than JavaScript that would accomplish the same thing. I think that the article is helpful, so you can use these things with CSS instead of fiddling with JavaScript.

### **Discuss Part 2**

1. The link to the original pen: \
   <https://codepen.io/HZaccaro/pen/zvrgLb>
2. The link to your pen: \
   <https://codepen.io/G_Arbo/pen/jOreyVL>
3. What is the purpose of the pen?\
   The original pen showed how to make something scroll smoothly using JavaScript, while my pen showed how much easier it was to do that with just CSS. Although, admittedly it is less configurable.
4. Is it successful to its purpose? 5. Why?\
   Yes, both pens show what they intend to do, although I think mine is more successful in accomplishing it concisely.
