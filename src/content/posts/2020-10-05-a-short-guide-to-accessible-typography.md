Accessibility is a very important part of web design that is \
often forgotten about. As a web developer it is important that we \
design websites that can be used by anyone. 


The first step to ensuring your typography is accessible \
is selecting a font that is easily legible. Legibility is often confused\
 with readability, which is how easy a block of text is to read, \
while legibility is how easily distinguishable characters in a font are \
from each other. Choosing a font that has characters that are \
distinct from each other is a must. This way your readers won’t\
 have a hard time telling which letter is which.

Another simple font tip is to ensure that your base font size is relative. \
People with reading disabilities or poor vision often set the base \
font size of their browser to be larger. This makes text easy to read \
without having to zoom-in, which can break some sites. For example, \
if you overwrite the base font size in px, the user won’t be able to \
adjust it. So use % instead, which modifies the user’s base font size, \
no matter what it is.

An important thing to check is the color and contrast of your text. \
There are a number of online contrast checkers that will tell you \
whether your text and background colors are high enough contrast. \
This ensures that your text is easy for everyone to read. Another \
aspect of contrast and color that isn’t given enough thought is \
the weight of the font. A light font may have the correct color, \
but will appear too faint and hard to read, so a heavier \
weight must be chosen. 

Something can make text very difficult to read for everyone, even \
those without reading disabilities is justified alignment. Justified text \
can leave large amounts of space between words and letters that \
greatly reduces readability. Another trap to avoid is center aligning\
 long paragraphs, it makes it difficult for those with reading \
disabilities to find the beginning of the lines. 

User’s with screen readers should also be kept in mind. It is important \
to properly use heading levels. Misusing them could cause screen \
readers to read your site in the wrong order and confuse the user.

Long lines of text can also be difficult to read. Our eyes can tire out \
reading long lines of text, and moving to the next line gives our eyes \
a slight break so we can keep on reading.  This goes doubly so for \
users with reading disabilities. Which is why you should generally try to \
keep your lines between 40-75 characters.

Hopefully these tips have helped you learn a thing or two about accessible\
typography. If we all put in some effort then we can ensure that the web \
is accessible to everyone.
